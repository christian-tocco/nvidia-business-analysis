# ðŸ“ˆ NVIDIA Business Analysis with Advanced Monte Carlo Simulation

This project presents a professional-grade financial analysis of NVIDIA using advanced stochastic modeling. The centerpiece is a robust Heston Monte Carlo simulation calibrated on historical volatility metrics.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Advanced Heston model with parameter calibration
- Real data from Yahoo Finance (2019â€“2024)
- 50,000+ Monte Carlo simulations with multi-year horizons
- Volatility calibration via moment matching (mean, variance, ACF)
- Clean Jupyter Notebook and code structure
- Modular design ready for extension and real use cases

## Goals

- Analyze the long-term price behavior of NVIDIA
- Stress-test probabilistic scenarios using realistic market dynamics
- Build a replicable financial model with academic-level accuracy
